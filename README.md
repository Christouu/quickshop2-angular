# quickshop2-angular

QuickShop is an Ecommerce web app build with MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). You can view and choose products to add to cart. You can pay for your order with credit/debit card. For the paying method I am using Stripe. Also for Admin users there is admin section, where you can control all users, products, orders. Also you can view your app progress, how many users you have, how much money you have made and other features.
